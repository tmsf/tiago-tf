            <description><![CDATA[<h1>hello world</h1>
<p>Oh boy, the amount of yak shaving that happened in order to get this note taking thingy up and running.</p>
<p>I wanted a simple, easy to create, edit, and delete posts within this static website. I didn&#39;t want no &quot;smart&quot; tools like jekyll, hugo, or anything like it. </p>
<h2>solution I</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve started digging and found a simple &quot;md to html&quot; converters on github. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve found a simple transformer. Quite rudimentary that did the job. </p>
<h3>Cool.</h3>
<p>But then I realised that I wanted to have a simple way to duplicate the headers to match my current design. </p>
<h2>solution II</h2>
<p>Into github again, I&#39;ve found another library that got the templating sorted. Little bash script. </p>
<h3>Done.</h3>
<p>Hum.. I need an index page so I can see the post list.
Ok, if I list the files I can automated around the npx script within the bash script. </p>
<h3>This is starting to look complicated...</h3>
<h2>solution III</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s add the index file.</p>
<h2>solution IV</h2>
<p>Dates, I need to add creation dates.</p>
<h2>solution V</h2>
<p><code>sitemap.xml</code> of course! Ok the bash file is getting out of control. I rather do this in the JS territory where all of this feels familiar.</p>
<h2>solution VI</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s lose some of the external libs, they&#39;re simpler to just rewrite in a new script. 
<em>RSS is also a cool feature don&#39;t forget to add it!</em></p>
<h2>solution VII</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s just use the same process as for the sitemap. we got it. </p>
<h3>I got it I reached perfection.</h3>
<h4>who am I kidding?</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s recap. I wanted just a simple blog where I could type a couple of thoughts, no hassles of external frameworks, or writting/duplicating boilerplate and html code all the time.</p>
<p>Where did I get to?</p>
<p>The script:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>âž• A node script that has an external dependency only. Doesn&#39;t need a full framework to render a dozen html files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>âž– for having a dependency and a preprocess step</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The blog requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>automatic timestamps in the files</p>
<ul>
<li>âž• it looks cool, and its quite easy to get a professional look, it will be useful for sitemap, rss. </li>
<li>âž– spent too much time on it to look... like a timestamp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code>sitemap.xml</code> </p>
<ul>
<li>âž• it just worked with a simple iteration on files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><code>rss.xml</code></p>
<ul>
<li>âž• just copied sitemaps&#39;s and got it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Am I happy?</h4>
<p>Of course not. The current css is wonky. The script is a mess of names and functions that make sense to no one. And I&#39;ll definetely will do all possible things besides writing on it.</p>
<p>Oh and for now, I&#39;m right there in the bottom right ðŸ‘‡ (<a href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/">Honestly Undefined</a>). </p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
